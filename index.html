    <h1>April 6 2020</h1>
    <p>An old friend, Zeina, asked a great question on Facebook, prompting me to think about books that made me a better teacher. It resulted in me cancelling my social media hiatus. How can I miss out on good things like this? Here is my list:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Paolo Freire</li>
<li>Teaching to Transgress, bell hooks</li>
<li>The Art of Critical Pedagogy, Jeff Duncan Andrade</li>
<li>The Color of Law, Richard Rothstein</li>
<li>The Shame of the Nation, Jonathan Kozol</li>
<li>For White Folks Who Teach in the Hood... and the Rest of Y'all Too Christopher Emdin</li> 
<li>Why Are All the Black Kids  Sitting Together in the Cafeteria, Beverly Daniel Tatum</li>
<li>The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander</li>
<li>White Fragility, Robin DiAngelo</li>
<li>Other People's Children, Lisa Delpit</li>
</ol>

            <li>I have been vibing with "What I talk about When I talk About Running" - Haruki Murakami. He reflects on starting to run in his early thirties and aging. It gives me hope that it's not too late for me to start writing a novel or run a marathon one day. Murakami often writes about thing that psychologically terrify me like being at the bottom of a well or turning thirty. I consumed the book in one sitting.</li>
            <li>My best friend Shannon has been wanting to read "The Testaments" by Margaret Atwood with me for some time. It finally came in from the library. I really enjoyed reading it with her and getting to discuss it. I decided to by both books by Atwood for my sister as an early birthday gift. Reading with someone else is so nice.</li>
            <li>The SF Chronicle posted a list books about baseball for us fans who are missing it this season. I'm going to hold off and start it in the summer, but I'm glad it exists. Notably, it misses "Home Team: The Turbulent History of the San Francisco Giants" which I find to be underrated, especially amongst Giants fans.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>I think Rachel Ray is Trash.</li>
            <li>Also Gretchin Rubin.</li>
            <li>Today was a frustrating reading day.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>God bless everyone who is baking bread right now.<br>God bless everyone making matzo brei.</p>
        <p>Musically, 90s music is making me feel good. I have playlists for the best music of 97, 98, and 99. Here are some books that made my heart lighter today:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"The Book of Joy" - Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu: It was hard not being able to worship with others. I spent a lot of time talking about my faith and spiritualty today with mi novio. We have different ideas about these things, but that's what keeps life interesting.</li>
            <li>"Heartburn"/"I Feel Bad About My Neck" - Nora Ephron: Heartburn has this funny motif of recipes, none of which seem appealing to me. I like Ephron's food writing, and I am growing an appreciation for food writing in general. Like Murakami, Ephron writes about aging in a way that I need right now as I'm staring down 30 (don't judge me!!)</li>
            <li>Dining In - Alison Roman: Trendy and I can see why! I would love to be a better cook. One of my intentions this year was to cook more. Sometimes it feels like this quarantine has funny timing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>April 16 2020</h1>
        <p>Last month, I had an informal book club with the CEO of Code Nation, Becca Novak. We don't often get chaces to have 1-1 conversations together, but we discussed Priya Parker's The Art of Gathering. Since then Parker wrote an article for the NYT about our religious gatherings that I was thinking about this week. I also feel like she named my zoom fatigue.</p>
        <p>This month, our book club doubled in size, in spite of the aforementioned zoom fatigue. We talked about Radical Candor, a book my organization is looking to adopt. I don't often (read: ever) recommend business management books, but it's nice to have a shared communication framework with people I work with. Here's a podcast instead that emerged from the conversation. I'm thinking about how I show up authentically at work a little more nowadays and my work self vs. home self and how to uncleave them.</p>
        <p>The students I work with at Oakland International are reading Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages so now I am reading The Five Love Languages and developing a project based on the five love languages. You can see that here. I'm also thinking about what this become in the future and trying to compile it somewhere.</p>
        <p>For something completely different: this NYT article about butch culture. I adore Alison Bechdel and Roxane Gay. That is all.</p>
